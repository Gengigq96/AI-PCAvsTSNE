# AI-PCAvsTSNE
This project aims to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding). Through these methods, we can effectively visualize the distribution and relationships between data points in a two-dimensional space.
